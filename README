This is a very simple Python 2 module with one function returning the
amount of time in milliseconds since last user activity. It only works
under X11.

To install it, run:

python2 setup.py install

To use its only function:

import actmon
actmon.get_idle_time()

actmon.get_idle_time() returns the number of milliseconds since last
user activity (mouse, keyboard) under X11.
